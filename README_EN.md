# TG-AutoSign

[中文说明](README.md) | [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

TG-AutoSign is a Telegram automation project with a web management panel. It supports multi-account management, auto sign-in workflows, message and button actions, AI-assisted tasks, execution logs, and Docker-based deployment.

> This repository continues maintenance on top of earlier projects, and the current maintained version has been developed and organized end-to-end with GitHub Copilot, including panelization, containerization, unified client device parameters, and deployment guidance.

## Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full update history.

## Recent Updates

- 2026-04-28 Duplicate clicks on the same sign task now show the already-running response as informational feedback instead of a failure toast
- 2026-04-28 The run monitor no longer renders still-running duplicate submissions as failures, and the structured message event label for “Message sent” is restored
- 2026-04-26 Submit manual sign tasks to a background runner so the API returns immediately while the UI follows live progress and historical flow logs
- 2026-04-26 Add Chinese phase status, duplicate protection for the same account-task pair, queued same-account hints, and blocking task progress details
- 2026-04-26 Cancel only the waiting job on account-lock timeout, persist failure history without interrupting the blocking job, and keep `SIGN_TASK_HISTORY_MAX_ENTRIES=100`
- 2026-04-26 Align the dashboard run-log count and latest-message typography, and remove the duplicate latest-summary line from expanded account task history entries

## Capabilities

- Manage multiple Telegram accounts in one place
- Import and export account packages in Telethon-compatible and Telegram Desktop TData formats
- Automate sign-ins, scheduled messages, and button actions
- Use AI Vision and AI Calculate actions in workflows
- Inspect logs, structured message history, and account states from a web panel
- Run with Docker, Docker Compose, and GHCR image publishing
- Unify Telegram Client device parameters for consistent deployments

## Telegram Task Completion Notifications

- Configure the default Bot Token and Chat ID in `UI -> System Settings -> Telegram Bot Notifications`
- Override notifications per account in the dashboard edit dialog with `Use global / Custom / Disabled`
- Regular tasks and sign tasks both send best-effort completion messages after manual and scheduled runs; notification failures do not change task results
- No new Docker or Compose environment variables are required for this feature

## Quick Start

Default admin account:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: if `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is not set, the default password is `admin123`

`ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` are used only when the user table is empty and the initial administrator is created. If users already exist or a persisted `/data/db.sqlite` is present, changing the environment variables will not overwrite the existing account; update it in the UI or reinitialize/migrate the data instead.

Change the password immediately after first login.

### Method 1: Start with a Docker command

The most direct way is to run the image directly:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name tg-autosign \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/data \
  -e TZ=Asia/Shanghai \
  -e APP_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key \
  -e ADMIN_USERNAME=admin \
  -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=change_me \
  ghcr.io/lyc1466/tg-autosign:latest
```

If you use a reverse proxy, bind locally only:

```bash
-p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080
```

Then visit: `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8080`

### Method 2: Start with Docker Compose

The repository already provides two Compose files:

- `docker-compose.yml`: a concise version with only the most common deployment settings
- `docker-compose.full.yml`: a fully commented version that lists all runtime settings still managed by environment variables

Use the concise version:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Use the full commented version:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.full.yml up -d
```

Notes:

- At minimum, change `APP_SECRET_KEY`, and usually `ADMIN_PASSWORD` as well
- Telegram API, AI settings, task-completion Bot notifications, and the data directory are now managed from `UI -> System Settings`, so they are intentionally omitted from Compose env
- Use `docker-compose.yml` when you want the fastest deployment path
- Use `docker-compose.full.yml` when you need proxy settings, device overrides, task tuning, or the optional hardening block

Then visit: `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8080`

### Method 3: Download the source code and run it

If you prefer running from source, a typical flow is:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lyc1466/TG-AutoSign.git
cd TG-AutoSign
```

1. Prepare environment variables based on `.env.example`
  If you launch from a shell directly, you can export them manually
  `APP_SECRET_KEY` must be set for a real run
2. Install Python dependencies
3. Install frontend dependencies and build static assets
4. Start the backend service

A common example flow:

```bash
pip install -e .
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

Then visit: `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8080`

## Build with Proxy When Downloads Stall

If `docker build` stalls during dependency downloads, try:

```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890 \
  --build-arg HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890 \
  -t tg-autosign .
```

## Data Directory and Permissions

- Default data directory: `/data`
- If `/data` is not writable, the current implementation falls back to `/tmp/tg-signpulse` (non-persistent)
- The container tries to adapt runtime permissions to the mounted volume, but the mounted path should still be writable

Useful checks inside the container:

```bash
id
ls -ld /data
touch /data/.probe && rm /data/.probe
```

## Account Package Import And Export

The account page toolbar provides “Import Accounts”, “Export Telethon”, and “Export TData”. These Zip packages contain Telegram login sessions, so store them as sensitive files.

Supported import formats:

- Telethon-compatible packages: one folder per account containing `.json` and `.session`; compatible with independent WTelegram sessions exported by Telegram-Panel, Telethon/Pyrogram SQLite sessions, and JSON `session_string`.
- TData packages: a Zip containing a `tdata/` directory, either as a single-account package or multiple account folders.
- Optional `2fa.txt` / `password.txt` files are stored as private account metadata for migration use.

Imports skip same-name accounts by default. Enable “Allow overwrite” in the import dialog to replace existing sessions. TData import/export requires Node plus `@mtcute/convert`; the official image preinstalls them. Source runs install them on first use into `TG_TDATA_RUNTIME_DIR`, or into `tdata-runtime` under the data directory when unset.

## Health Checks

- `GET /healthz`: quick health check
- `GET /readyz`: readiness check

## Unified Configuration Priority

Runtime configuration is now routed through a unified layer. When deploying, read precedence in this order:

1. Most base runtime settings are still primarily driven by container or process environment variables.
2. A small set of persisted settings follow their own rules, especially Telegram API credentials, AI configuration, Telegram completion notification settings, and the data directory.
3. Built-in defaults are used only when the relevant env or persisted source does not provide a value.

Key rules:

- Telegram API credentials now follow `.telegram_api.json` > `TG_API_ID` / `TG_API_HASH` > built-in defaults. This lets you inject credentials through env for the first boot, then let later UI changes take precedence.
- Telegram completion notifications are stored in `.telegram_notification.json` for the global default, while per-account overrides live in the account profile store and do not require extra environment variables.
- AI configuration is now read from `.openai_config.json`; if the UI has not stored it, AI is treated as disabled.
- The effective data directory now comes from the override file pointed to by `APP_DATA_DIR_OVERRIDE_FILE`; when unset, the default remains `/data`.
- Per-request or per-login explicit proxy > account proxy > `TG_PROXY`.
- `TG_SESSION_NO_UPDATES` > `TG_NO_UPDATES` (compatibility alias).
- Base runtime knobs such as `APP_*`, `SIGN_TASK_*`, `TG_DEVICE_*`, and `TG_SIGNER_*` are mainly env-driven and are not overridden back from the panel.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` is a frontend build-time variable; changing it requires rebuilding frontend assets or the image.

## Custom Data Directory

The data directory is now managed from the UI:

1. Panel: `System Settings -> Global Settings -> Data Directory`
2. In advanced setups, `APP_DATA_DIR_OVERRIDE_FILE` only changes where that UI-managed override is stored

Notes:

- The panel stores its value through the data-directory override file.
- If the UI has never stored a value, the runtime default remains `/data`.

Recommendations:

- Restart the service after changing it
- The target directory must be writable
- Mount it as a persistent volume in production
